# 🏠 Property Listings Web App

A full-stack **rental property web application** where users can browse, explore, and view listings — inspired by platforms like **Airbnb**.

This project is built with **Node.js**, **Express**, **MongoDB (Mongoose)**, and server-side rendered using **EJS** templates.  
It is fully deployed on **Render** and connects to a cloud-based MongoDB Atlas database.

🌍 **Production URL**: [https://project-1-ikl0.onrender.com/listings](https://project-1-ikl0.onrender.com/listings)

> 🧪 Note: If the site takes a few seconds to load, it's because free Render services can go to sleep.

## 📖 Overview

The app showcases a list of properties with details like:
- 🏷️ Title
- 📍 Location
- 💰 Price
- 📝 Description
- 🖼️ Image (static or from a database)

Each listing has its own detailed page. This makes it ideal for building a real-estate or Airbnb clone MVP.
